# BeCreative_hackathon
Control the world with your bare hands. The colors of your fingertips, shall
create the difference between peace and evil.
Green activates a small beautiful bird, which makes the world a peaceful satisfying area. The blue finger dives deep into the blue seas, to find a whale.

The yellow finger creates a giant fores fire. It demolishes our beautiful green planet. The red finger starts the chainsaw and cuts down all the oxygen generating trees.

Using:
- Daisy Seed for controlling the music and reading the sensors
- 2x 3W class D amplifiers for actuating the speakers
- 2x 3W speakers
- 3 axis magnetic field sensor
- Color sensor
- Proximity sensor

The _convert.py_ file contains a script to generate a header file
containing the audio samples for *fire*, *whale*, *chainsaw*, and a *bird*.

The _hackathon.ino_ file contains the source code for the microcontroller.
After running the python script, the arduino environment can be used for
controlling the _earth_ with your own hands.
